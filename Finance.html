                <h3> Market Analysis </h3>
				Our product is very useful for people who own pools or <br>
				beachfront properties in polluted waters.<br>
				 The Waterumba can easily clean up waters around popular beaches, <br>
				 allowing a beautiful and clean vacation spot. <br> 
				 In addition, cleaning pools can be very tiresome, <br>
				 but just place them in a Waterumba and it’ll be spotless within hours! <br>
				It can also be purchased to help cleanse the oceans <br>
				of the massive amounts of floating trash piles, <br>
				which can destroy entire ecosystems and harms wildlife! <br>
				<p>
				<h3> Financial Plan </h3>
				Our Waterumbas cost $500 dollars each, <br>
				as they are reusable and the fact that they also run on water. <br>
				A regular Roomba that runs on land is usually <br>
				around $200-$1000, depending on the model and the features. <br>
				We also offer free repairs after the purchase for one year  <br>
				if the Waterumba is damaged, broken, or not working properly. <br>
				We will also hold fundraisers and donations for <br>
				local charities or investors to start up our business <br>
				and help clean Earth’s waters. <br>
