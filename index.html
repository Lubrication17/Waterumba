                <h3> Team History</h3>
                Our team is from California and met  <br>
                at Palo Alto High over the summer. <br>
                We all had an interest in the growing water pollution problem <br>
                and wanted to put an end to it. <br>
                After we thought of our solution, <br>
                a machine called the "Waterumba", <br>
                we realized our product would work <br>
                both in oceans, lakes, and bays as well as pools, so we decided <br>
                to combine both cleaning pools as well as our oceans together. <br>
                We had some  disagreements on design and logos, <br>
                but eventually we settled on our current design choice,<br>
                and after many months of hard work, <br>
                we have finally finished our Waterumba <br>
                and we are ready to present it to you. <br>
                <P>
                <h3> Overview </h3>
                The Waterumba is a high-tech cleaning machine <br>
                that is well suited for  all dirty or polluted bodies of waters <br>
                throughout the globe. Just place it on top of any polluted water, <br>
                and itâ€™ll start cleaning out all filth in the given area. <br>
                <p>
                <h3> Benefits </h3>
                The Waterumba is very flexible in whatever 
                aquatic environment you place it in. <br>
                We use sensors to avoid walls <br>
                 and any wildlife while targeting filth.  <br>
                It can function for very large amounts of time, <br>
                as our Waterumba is solar powered.  <br>
                If a storm were to come and block out the sun, <br>
                the Waterumba is stocked with backup batteries  <br>
                that can last up to 10 hours! <br>
                You can change the mode of the Waterumba  <br>
                on an included app on your device. <br>
                The two modes are auto or remote control.  <br>
